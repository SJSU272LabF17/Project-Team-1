### Simplification of Employee Recruitment Process using BlockChain Technology

Simplification of recruitment process by eliminating third party agencies to validate the work history of the potential / future employees. We are going to leverage the blockchain technology to implement this idea. In existing world, employers are spending a lot of money for third party agencies to perform the background checks of the potential candidates. It takes more time for the BGC to complete, hence delaying the hiring process. Using the above proposed solution, we can save the lot of time and money of the employers and quickens the recruitment process.

Blockchain Server : ec2-54-153-99-130.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

Application Server : ec2-54-153-89-146.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

### Methodology 

We are using open source platform hyperledger composer for creating blockchain business network.

User Interface will be developed using ReactJ. ReactJS application will be connecting to backend hyperledger application using REST api to create Participant, Assets and Transactions. 

Docker image of the application will be created and application will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
