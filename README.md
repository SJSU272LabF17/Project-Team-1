### Simplification of Employee Recruitment Process using BlockChain Technology

Simplification of recruitment process by eliminating third party agencies to validate the work history of the potential / future employees. We are going to leverage the blockchain technology to implement this idea. In existing world, employers are spending a lot of money for third party agencies to perform the background checks of the potential candidates. It takes more time for the BGC to complete, hence delaying the hiring process. Using the above proposed solution, we can save the lot of time and money of the employers and quickens the recruitment process.

### Problem Statement

The employee recruitment process is the most cumbersome task for any company. It involves long duration of waiting for records about the candidate from various organiza-tions/institutions such as Universities, Previous Companies, Police, Workers Compensation Claims etc. Simplication of these process will reduce the man hours for several entities and also reduces huge amount of money and workload spent by companies for employee recruitement process.

### Proposed Solution

Blockchain technology, with its immutable blocks has made it easier to validate a particular candidate. Moreover, its secure and distributed nature has made it a must-have for large organizations and companies. In this project, we have strived to achieve such an implementation that reduces the manual workload that the third-parties have to indulge into. This website utilizes Hyperledger Composer as the infrastructure and Fabric as the network. It successfully manages to create blocks for each candidate, with its unique identifier. This chain is distributed over a network of peers that share a ledger, that keeps records of that particular employee. Such a robust and fault tolerant structure provided by the blockchain technology is sure to be a boon to all the companies that have to scrutinize the candidate.

Project Report : https://github.com/SJSU272LabF17/Recruit-Chain/blob/master/CMPE272-ProjectReport.pdf


### Methodology 

We are using open source platform hyperledger composer for creating blockchain business network.

User Interface will be developed using ReactJ. ReactJS application will be connecting to backend hyperledger application using REST api to create Participant, Assets and Transactions. 

Docker image of the application will be created and application will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Conclusion

Blockchain technology is indeed the most perfect fit for performing background checks for an employee since it pro-duces immutable blocks with an added security factor and fault tolerant structure. These project leverages blockchain advantages to simplify the recruitement process.
